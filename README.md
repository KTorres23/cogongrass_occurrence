### Abstract

Cogongrass is an invasive species of grass in the United States and infamously known as the
“seventh worst weed in the world” (1). It was introduced to Alabama in 1911 and has since
spread across the southeastern U.S. due to its fire-adapted, resilient nature and consequent
eradication failures (1). Cogongrass displaces native plants, offers little ecological value, and is a
nuisance on pastures and turfgrass lawns (2). Current detection programs for cogongrass include
iNaturalist, a citizen science platform for documenting biodiversity, and EDDMapS, a platform
designed for early detection of invasive species. While the EDDMapS is a good tool for
documenting cogongrass, it was not designed with user accessibility in mind and does not have
functions for querying the database. The “Invasive Cogongrass Occurrence” web application will
create an accessible interface for visualizing and documenting the invasion of cogongrass
(Imperata cylindrica) across the U.S. The application will be based on pre-existing observations
of cogongrass from iNaturalist and EDDMapS. Users will be able to add records and query and
update the cogongrass database. Additionally, polygons of the Wildland-Urban Interface and
U.S. protected areas will be included on the map, allowing users to better understand where
cogongrass invasion is occurring. Wildland urban interfaces (WUI) are important to
understanding cogongrass detection because the WUI can facilitate the introduction and spread
of invasive species (3). Similarly, the extent of invasion in U.S. protected areas can inform
certain agencies or public land parcels of the need for targeted cogongrass management. Using
plotly (4), the application will also provide a feature that summarizes basic informational
statistics of selected records or records within an area of interest. Information regarding current
news and quick facts on cogongrass invasion and eradication efforts will be updated regularly for
managers and scientists. The Invasive Cogongrass Occurrence web application will serve as an
alternative tool for detecting cogongrass and understanding its extent of invasion in the U.S.
